# 🏦 ATM Simulation Program  

This **ATM Simulation Program** is a Python-based interactive system that mimics the functionalities of a real ATM, including **cash withdrawal, deposit, and PIN change**.  

## 🔹 Features  
✅ **Card Verification** - Simulates card insertion before proceeding.  
✅ **User Authentication** - Requires a **4-digit PIN** (with a maximum of 3 attempts).  
✅ **Account Balance Inquiry** - Displays the **current account balance**.  
✅ **Cash Withdrawal** - Allows users to withdraw money if they have sufficient balance.  
✅ **Money Deposit** - Enables users to **add money** to their account.  
✅ **PIN Change** - Users can update their **4-digit PIN** securely.  

## 📌 How It Works  
1️⃣ Insert the card (simulated by entering `1`).  
2️⃣ Enter the correct **PIN** (default: `9440`).  
3️⃣ Choose from the following options:  
   - `2`: **Withdraw Money** 💰  
   - `3`: **Deposit Money** 💵  
   - `4`: **Change PIN** 🔑  
4️⃣ Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the transaction.  
5️⃣ If the PIN is entered incorrectly **3 times**, access is denied.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
🔹 **Python** - Core programming language for logic implementation.  
🔹 **Conditional Statements** - Controls program flow.  
🔹 **Loops** - Manages repeated PIN entry attempts.  
🔹 **User Input Handling** - Ensures smooth interaction.  

## ⚡ Expected Output  
🔹 Displays a **welcome message** upon inserting the card.  
🔹 Shows **account balance** before transactions.  
🔹 Allows **successful withdrawals and deposits** with balance updates.  
🔹 Securely updates the PIN when changed.  
🔹 Displays **error messages** for incorrect PINs or insufficient funds.  

💡 **This simple ATM simulation helps in understanding conditional logic, loops, and user authentication in Python!** 🚀
